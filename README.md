# Threat Hunting
In this repository, I'll do an attempt to share queries to hunt for adversaries/TTPs. I usually attempt to make them for Splunk, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and CrowdStrike Falcon. In the future, I might add more languages, but that depends.

In case of questions, feel free to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_P1NGW1NG) and slide in my DMs.

Cheers and happy hunting!
